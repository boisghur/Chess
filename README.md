# Chess
## In development

## About:

A chess engine and game with graphics designed in python with pygame. 

I recently started playing chess but I didn't want to pay for a chess.com membership, which is required if you wanna solve puzzles, so decided to build my own game.

I decided to use python because, prior to this game, I had only used python for data analytics and to build Choose your own adventure games.

## Completed:

* Move Log
* Undo Move
* Movement of pieces on the board
* Valid moves only for all pieces 
* Valid moves only when in check
* Valid moves only when a piece is pinned

## Goals:

* Complete special moves (En Passant/Pawn Promotion/Castling)
* Importing chess puzzles to solve.
* Simple AI to play against CPU.
* Online Multiplayer
* Move Database
